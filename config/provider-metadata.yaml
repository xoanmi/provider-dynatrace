            id: (String) The ID of this resource.
            id_pattern: (String) ID patterns are comprised of static text and placeholders referring to dimensions in the ingest data. An ID pattern must contain at least one placeholder to ensure that different entities will be created.. Take care that the pattern results in the same ID for the same entity. For example, using timestamp or counter-like dimensions as part of the ID would lead to the creation of new entities for each ingest data and is strongly discouraged!

            key: (String) The attribute key is the unique name of the attribute.
            name: (String) The entity type name. This type name must be unique and must not be changed after creation.
            pattern: (String) Pattern for specifying the value for the extracted attribute. Can be a static value, placeholders or a combination of both.
            required_dimension: '(Block Set, Min: 1) (see below for nested schema)'
            required_dimensions: '(Block List, Max: 1) In addition to the dimensions already referred to in the ID pattern, you may specify additional dimensions which must be present in order to evaluate this rule. (see below for nested schema)'
            role: (String) If you want to extract multiple entities of the same type from a single ingest line you need to define multiple rules with different roles.
            rule: '(Block List, Min: 1) (see below for nested schema)'
            rules: '(Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) Specify a list of rules which are evaluated in order. When any rule matches, the entity defined according to that rule will be extracted. Subsequent rules will not be evaluated. (see below for nested schema)'

            dynatrace_ddu_pool: ) exist just as a singleton on a Dynatrace Environment. It makes much more sense to configure the settings you would like to enforce using a normal resource block. dynatrace_golden_state wouldn't bring in any benefits as it just focuses on deleting.
            dynatrace_golden_state: is not yet feature complete. Every resource it currently supports needs to get manually tested against a brand new environment. Essentially in order to ensure that neither of the two previous reasons are applicable. About 60% of all resources have been tested through already. We're adding support for additional resources gradually.

We've decided to not mess around with these resources in order to avoid inconsistencies when dynatrace_golden_state is configured to automatically delete settings.

            cost_and_traffic_control: (Number) Percentage of user sessions captured and analyzed. By default, Dynatrace captures all user actions and user sessions for analysis. This approach ensures complete insight into your application’s performance and customer experience. You can optionally reduce the granularity of user-action and user-session analysis by capturing a lower percentage of user sessions. While this approach can reduce monitoring costs, it also results in lower visibility into how your customers are using your applications. For example, a setting of 10% results in Dynatrace analyzing only every tenth user session.

        argumentDocs:
            add_node_js_script_name: (Boolean) In older versions, Node.js applications were distinguished based on their directory name, omitting the script name. Changing this setting may change the general handling of Node.js process groups. Leave unchanged if in doubt.
            auto_detect_cassandra_clusters: (Boolean) Enabling this flag will detect separate Cassandra process groups based on the configured Cassandra cluster name.
            auto_detect_spring_boot: (Boolean) Enabling this flag will detect Spring Boot process groups based on command line and applications' configuration files.
            auto_detect_tibco_container_edition_engines: (Boolean) Enabling this flag will detect separate TIBCO BusinessWorks process groups per engine property file.

            builtin:process-group.detection-flags: )
            group_ibmmqby_instance_name: (Boolean) Enable to group and separately analyze the processes of each IBM MQ Queue manager instance. Each process group receives a unique name based on the queue manager instance name.
            id: (String) The ID of this resource.
            identify_jboss_server_by_system_property: (Boolean) Enabling this flag will detect the JBoss server name from the system property jboss.server.name=, only if -D[Server:] is not set.
            ignore_unique_identifiers: (Boolean) To determine the unique identity of each detected process, and to generate a unique name for each detected process, Dynatrace evaluates the name of the directory that each process binary is contained within. For application containers like Tomcat and JBoss, Dynatrace evaluates important directories like CATALINA_HOME and JBOSS_HOME for this information. In some automated deployment scenarios such directory names are updated automatically with new version numbers, build numbers, dates, or GUIDs. Enable this setting to ensure that automated directory name changes don't result in Dynatrace registering pre-existing processes as new processes.
            scope: (String) The scope of this setting (HOST, HOST_GROUP). Omit this property if you want to cover the whole environment.
            short_lived_processes_monitoring: (Boolean) Enable to monitor CPU and memory usage of short lived processes, otherwise being lost by traditional monitoring. Disabling this flag blocks passing data to cluster only, it does not stop data collection and has no effect on performance.
            split_oracle_database_pg: (Boolean) Enable to group and separately analyze the processes of each Oracle DB. Each process group receives a unique name based on the Oracle DB SID.
            split_oracle_listener_pg: (Boolean) Enable to group and separately analyze the processes of each Oracle Listener. Each process group receives a unique name based on the Oracle Listener name.

            use_catalina_base: (Boolean) By default, Tomcat clusters are identified and named based on the CATALINA_HOME directory name. This setting results in the use of the CATALINA_BASE directory name to identify multiple Tomcat nodes within each Tomcat cluster. If this setting is not enabled, each CATALINA_HOME+CATALINA_BASE combination will be considered a separate Tomcat cluster. In other words, Tomcat clusters can't have multiple nodes on a single host.
            use_docker_container_name: (Boolean) By default, Dynatrace uses image names as identifiers for individual process groups, with one process-group instance per host. Normally Docker container names can't serve as stable identifiers of process group instances because they are variable and auto-generated. You can however manually assign proper container names to their Docker instances. Such manually-assigned container names can serve as reliable process-group instance identifiers. This flag instructs Dynatrace to use Docker-provided names to distinguish between multiple instances of the same image. If this flag is not applied and you run multiple containers of the same image on the same host, the resulting processes will be consolidated into a single process view. Use this flag with caution!

The context is set for tags that are automatically imported by OneAgent (for example, from the AWS console or environment variables). It’s useful for determining the origin of tags when not manually defined, and it also helps to prevent clashes with other existing tags. If the tag is not automatically imported, CONTEXTLESS set. Possible values are AWS, AWS_GENERIC, AZURE, CLOUD_FOUNDRY, CONTEXTLESS, ENVIRONMENT, GOOGLE_COMPUTE_ENGINE and KUBERNETES

            key: (String) The key of the tag. For custom tags, put the tag value here. The key allows categorization of multiple tags. It is possible that there are multiple values for a single key which will all be represented as standalone tags. Therefore, the key does not have the semantic of a map key but is more like a key of a key-value tuple. In some cases, for example custom tags, the key represents the actual tag value and the value field is not set – those are called valueless tags
