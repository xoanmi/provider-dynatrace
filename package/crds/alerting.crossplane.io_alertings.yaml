For example, if you chose the Slowdown (`PERFORMANCE`) severity and Unexpected high traffic (`APPLICATION_UNEXPECTED_HIGH_LOAD`) event with **negate** set to `true`, the alerting profile will trigger only when the slowdown problem is raised while there is no unexpected high traffic event.  Consider the following use case as an example. The Slowdown (`PERFORMANCE`) severity rule is set. Depending on the configuration of the event filter (Unexpected high traffic (`APPLICATION_UNEXPECTED_HIGH_LOAD`) event is used as an example), the options of the alerting profile is one of the following:* **negate** is set to `false`: The alert triggers when the slowdown problem is raised while unexpected high traffic event is happening.  * **negate** is set to `true`: The alert triggers when the slowdown problem is raised while there is no unexpected high traffic event.  * no event rule is set: The alert triggers when the slowdown problem is raised, regardless of any events

For example, if you chose the Slowdown (`PERFORMANCE`) severity and Unexpected high traffic (`APPLICATION_UNEXPECTED_HIGH_LOAD`) event with **negate** set to `true`, the alerting profile will trigger only when the slowdown problem is raised while there is no unexpected high traffic event.  Consider the following use case as an example. The Slowdown (`PERFORMANCE`) severity rule is set. Depending on the configuration of the event filter (Unexpected high traffic (`APPLICATION_UNEXPECTED_HIGH_LOAD`) event is used as an example), the options of the alerting profile is one of the following:* **negate** is set to `false`: The alert triggers when the slowdown problem is raised while unexpected high traffic event is happening.  * **negate** is set to `true`: The alert triggers when the slowdown problem is raised while there is no unexpected high traffic event.  * no event rule is set: The alert triggers when the slowdown problem is raised, regardless of any events

                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out
                  through a Crossplane feature flag.
                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
                  See the design doc for more information: https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/499895a25d1a1a0ba1604944ef98ac7a1a71f197/design/design-doc-observe-only-resources.md?plain=1#L223

For example, if you chose the Slowdown (`PERFORMANCE`) severity and Unexpected high traffic (`APPLICATION_UNEXPECTED_HIGH_LOAD`) event with **negate** set to `true`, the alerting profile will trigger only when the slowdown problem is raised while there is no unexpected high traffic event.  Consider the following use case as an example. The Slowdown (`PERFORMANCE`) severity rule is set. Depending on the configuration of the event filter (Unexpected high traffic (`APPLICATION_UNEXPECTED_HIGH_LOAD`) event is used as an example), the options of the alerting profile is one of the following:* **negate** is set to `false`: The alert triggers when the slowdown problem is raised while unexpected high traffic event is happening.  * **negate** is set to `true`: The alert triggers when the slowdown problem is raised while there is no unexpected high traffic event.  * no event rule is set: The alert triggers when the slowdown problem is raised, regardless of any events
